Java Notes
- Java uses two types of memory allocation - Stack, Heap
-Four Types of access modifiers in java - Private,Default,Protected,Public
- Private can only be access within class;
- Default can be access within class and same package and not outside the package.
- Protected can be access within class and same package and outside the package only through inheritance.
- Public can be access anywhere.

- Class is blueprint of how our object looks like.It includes Data members or member functions.
- Object is an instance of a class from which we can access different data members or member functions.We can also say
 it is an entity that has state and behavior.

- Constructor is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.Constructor name is same as class name
- Thereare two types of copnstructor in java.
1. Default constructor
2. Parameterized constructor
- Default constructor is a constructor which is created by compiler if we do not create any constructor.
- Parameterized constructor is a constructor which is created by us and we can pass the parameters to it.
Constructor overloading means having same class name but different parameters.
Method overloading means having same method name but different parameters.

- Four Properties of Oops that follows in java 
1.Inheritance
-  Inheritance is property where a child/subclass inherit all the properties and behaviour of its parent/super class.
It can also have its extra properties.
ADVANTAGE OF Inheritance: - It makes the code reuseability and code deliveribility.
- We can also achieve Method overiding(overiding means changing the properties of super/parent class method by child) in java by using tag @overiding.

2.Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the bundling of data and 
methods that operate on that data within a single unit, which is called a class in Java. Encapsulation is a way of hiding 
the implementation details of a class from outside access and only exposing a public interface that can be used to interact with the class.
In Java, encapsulation is achieved by declaring the instance variables of a class as private, which means they can only be accessed within the class.
 To allow outside access to the instance variables, public methods called getters and setters are defined, which are used to retrieve and modify the values
  of the instance variables, respectively.

3.Abstraction
- Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
- Abstraction can be achieved by using abstract class and interface.
- An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods 
in the Java interface,
 not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
- a varible declared in interface is by default public static final and a method is by default public and abstract.
Ex-  int a;
  by compiler - public static final int a;
Ex- void print();
  by compiler - public abstract void print();
- Abstract class could have abstract(without body) method and Non-abstract method.
- It could also have a constructor.
- Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
4.Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is doing something in diffrent way.
It can be achieve by method overloading and overiding.

- Strings are immutable in java it means you cannot change the value of it, you have to convert it into an char array then you can change it.
- String builder and String buffer make mutable String variable.It means we can modify the String using setcharat func.
- insert,delete,setcharat,append are different function of string builder.
- To convert primitive data types to string we can use string.value of method.
- We can use String builder to add char array into it and then we can use .to string method to convert it into string.
- we can also add a whole string to string builder using append function.
- There are three string class - String , StringBuffer, StringBuilder
-  String class use new heap memory everytime you add String to it whereas string buffer and string builder use same heap memory to add new string.Hence saves time complexity and space complexity.
- We cannot use pass by refrence in java therefore you can use global variable and make changes.
- To Make a global variable we can use static and final keyword.
-If we use static variable, its value will not change after each object call.(one time memory allocation)
  ex-  static a =50;
       now you change its value to 100;
       then its value be 100 even if you call a new object of class.
-Final keywords is used to restrict the use of variable,method and class.You cannot change the value after using
final keywords.

Sorting

- Selection sort - selection sort is basically finding the smallest number and then replacing it one by one index.It basically has sorted and unsorted array
- Insertion sort is bascially looping over each array value and check whether the number is small or not than the previous one if it is then swap it. We have to do this until the number is small with the previous one.
- Bubble sort is vice versa of selection sort here we will swap the largest number with neighbour.Also here we swap continously until we put the largest element in that iteration.
- Merge sort is divide and rule method.first we divide the array in half and do recursively and then we sort those half array and at last merge it.
- Quick sort is also divide and rule method. Here we first set the pivot element and then put all the element which is small to pivot to left and the element which is largest to pivot to right.
then will do recursive sort on partition.(pivot index)
- Heap Sort
Heap sort is basically done by methods, 1 is upheapify and 2 is downheapify.
In Upheapify we start with starting index of array to length of array and making a parent by (i-2)/2 and then we check other elements one by one.If it is small them we swap the element with parent.And the new parent will be the index which have been swap.we do this in while loop until the parent is small than the element.
- AFTER The array is uoheapify then we do downheapify.Here we will always take the top most element and switch it with the last endex.As the top one is small one.Also we will call downheapify by changing the last index-1.
- In downheapify after we switch the top with end.Now we have to check the child. we get two childs always by child1 = 2*i+1 and child2 = 2*i+2.Now we check until the child is small than the parent.if it is then we switch the parent with child and new parent will be child we have switched.And the new child will be again child1 = 2*i+1 and child2 = 2*i+2

- RECURSION
- Recursion is a process in which a method calls itself continuously. A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method. It makes the code compact but complex to understand.
- There are four types of recursion 
- Tail Recursion -  Function calls itself at the end of func.
- Non-Tail Recursion _ Function calls itself Not at the end of func.
- Indirect recursion _ Function calls another function which calls the same function.
- nested recursion _ Function calls itself inside the function.

Arrays have two issues
- It only be declared in the contigous memory location.(contigous means continously).
- It has fixed size.
 Thats why we use Array List.it solved both issues.
 We can delete or increase a list size.

 Arrays store primitive data types like int,float,bool etc and also objects like Integer and Strings
 But Array list stores only Objects like Integer and String and not primitive data type because primitive datatypes
 need to be define the memory initially
